                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p> The plan to establish a nuclear power plant in the then East Pakistan was made in 1961. In 1963, the Rooppur village of the Pabna district was selected for the proposed plant and 254 acres of land was acquired. The plan was to establish a 200MW nuclear power plant in the selected site. Discussions took place with the Government of Canada ,Sweden and Norway were also going on in those years. However, no real progress was made. In 1970, the project was scrapped. </p>
                        <p>In 2015 the proposal was delayed by a year. Rosatom offered a two VVER-1200 reactor power plant, increasing output to 2.4 GWe. By December 2015 The Daily Star reported that the estimated cost of the plant had climbed to US$13 billion, from statements of around US$4 billion made earlier in the same year. German based Transparency International expressed concern on 28 December 2015 about the safety of the proposed plant. </p>

                        <h2>Construction</h2>
                        <p>In 2016 ground preparation work commenced. The $12.65 billion contract is 90% funded by a loan from the Russian government. The two units generating 2.4 GWe are planned to be operational in 2023 and 2024. </p>
                        <p>The nuclear reactor and critical infrastructure are being built by Russian companies. Atomenergomash is the engineering division of Russia's state nuclear corporation, Rosatom. This company is the supplier of all the equipment for the reactor compartment of Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant and a significant part of the equipment for the machine room.[  As of November 2017, more than 2,200 employees are at work at the site, including 450 Russian specialists. In the main construction period, the total number of employees will reach 12,500, including 2,500 specialists from Russia.</p>
                        <p>On 14 July 2018, the first concrete was poured for Unit 2. The following month, Rosatom began installing a 200-tonne core catcher as the first large piece of equipment in the reactor building of Rooppur 1, describing it as "a unique protection system".</p>
                        <p>When the COVID-19 pandemic struck Bangladesh in early 2020, the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant remained on track to be completed by 2023.</p>

                        <p>The Rooppur NPP incorporates the defence-in-depth protection, which is a multi-layer protection and mitigation system. Any human or man-made accidents can be mitigated using the system ensuring safety to the environment.</p>
                        <p>The system includes five layers of barriers( Fuel pellets, Fuel rods, Reactor shell, Core catcher& Reactor building)  which will prevent radiation exposure, as well as protect people and the environment.   </p>

                        <h2>Benefits</h2>
                        <p>Over the past decade, Bangladesh has made significant progress in the development of its power sector. The available installed capacity, excluding captive power and renewable energy, increased from 5823 MW in 2009-10 to 18079 MW in FY 19. Currently 93 percent people of Bangladesh have access to electricity facilities. The Government of Bangladesh has undertaken various projects to increase the generation of electricity to cope with the rapid increases in the demand to support the economic development.  Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant is one of the top priority projects. The first-ever nuclear power plant of the country will have two power units - each of 1,200MW capacity.  </p>
                        <p> The Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant will accelerate the growth of the country’s industrial sector and thus will contribute to the overall economic development. It will provide employment opportunities for locals and revenues from taxes which will help to support a healthy economy.  </p>
                        <p>It is suffice to say that the RNPP’s benefits are not limited to contributing to meeting Bangladesh’s energy demands, it creates a good number of employment opportunities, manufacturing capabilities, infrastructural development. The project has become a focal point of new-age of industrialization of the country which will pave the way for sustained economic development. </p>
                        <p>Thus, Rooppur NPP  plays  an important role in the power sector of the country to ensure energy security of the nation.</p>

                            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>Implementation of Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant is one of the best decisions of the Government taken for the generation of electricity so far. Already the construction process has started. But there are some safety and security issues present in the project. Bangladesh government should take necessary and proper steps regarding this. Hopefully, Rooppur Nuclear power Plant will solve the huge energy crisis of Bangladesh along with other power plants.</p>
